# Computer Setup: Java with sdkman
This repository contains the necessary tools and libraries to install [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) on a college's CS campus computers, without admin privilege! Tested at [Vanier College](https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/).

## Software requirements
To use this repo, you still need to install a Bash interpreter on the system in advance, such as Git Bash on Windows.

## Quick start
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `setup.sh` on Git Bash.

## Limitations
`sdkman` installs Java into your personal cloud partition, which may end up taking too much of your disk quota. A minimum of 2 GB of disk quota is recommended.
